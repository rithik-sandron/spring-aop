Java and SpringBoot:

Spring AOP:

Create an Aspect class and methods inside this class(methods inside aspect class is known as advices).
With these methods we can run custom code before, after or around a certain method or class or a package.

1. Annotations: 
    @Aspect
    @Component
    @Before
    @After
    @AfterReturning
    @AfterThrowing
    @Around
    @PointCut

    @Before, @After, @Around annotaions has their own unique args that we can pass.

2. Point cuts:
    @PointCut(“execution(<method-signature>)”) -> takes in method
    @PointCut(“execution(* *(..))”) -> generic approach of execution
    @PointCut(“within(<class or package>)”)  -> takes in class or package name
    @PointCut(“@annotation(Log)”) -> custom annotation

3. JoinPoint
    This is an object that advices can receive which contains useful info regarding the method for which top is applied



Design patterns:
Singleton
Proxy (factory)
